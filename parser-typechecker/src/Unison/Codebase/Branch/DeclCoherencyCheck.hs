-- | The "decl coherency check": a type declaration in a namespace is "coherent" if it satisfies both of the following
-- criteria.
--
--   1. For each naming of the type decl (say "Foo"#foohash), there exists exactly one name for each of its constructors
--      arbitrarily deep in the corresponding namespace ("Foo" in this example).
--
--      This allows us to render the decl naturally, as in
--
--        structural type Foo
--          = Bar Nat Int
--          | internal.hello.Bonk Nat
--
--      which corresponds to the three names
--
--        "Foo"                     => #foohash
--        "Foo.Bar"                 => #foohash#0
--        "Foo.internal.hello.Bonk" => #foohash#1
--
--      We could not do if there was at least one constructor whose full name does not contain the full name of the type
--      decl itself as a prefix.
--
--      A notable consequence of this requirement is that a second naming of a decl (i.e. an alias) cannot be embedded
--      within the first naming, as in:
--
--        type Foo = ...
--        type Foo.some.inner.namespace = ... -- an alias of Foo
--
--   2. No constructor has a "stray" name that does not have a prefix that equals the type declaration's name. For
--      example, in the namespace
--
--        "Foo"                 => #foohash
--        "Foo.Bar"             => #foohash#0
--        "Deep.What.SomeAlias" => #foohash#0
--
--      the constructor "What.SomeAlias" is "stray", as the type decl #foohash has no name that matches any prefix
--      (i.e. "Deep.What" nor "Deep").
--
-- On to the implementation. We are going to traverse the namespace depth-first. As we go, we have a stateful mapping
-- between decl reference that we *have* seen a name for in one of our parent namespace, and its corresponding set of
-- constructors that we *haven't* yet seen names for, but expect to, before fully searching the corresponding
-- sub-namespace (e.g. the child namespace named "Foo" of the namepace that declares a decl "Foo").
--
-- When processing a namespace, we first process all terms. Each constructor will fall into one of three cases:
--
-- > +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
-- > | Case         | Mapping before       | Encountered constructor | Mapping after                                  |
-- > +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
-- > | Happy path   | { #foo : {0, 1, 2} } | #foo#1                  | { #foo : {0, 2} }                              |
-- > | Already seen | { #foo : {0, 1, 2} } | #foo#5                  | Error: duplicate naming for constructor #foo#5 |
-- > | Never seen   | { #foo : {0, 1, 2} } | #bar#2                  | Error: stray constructor #bar#2                |
-- > +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
--
-- In "happy path", we see a naming of a constructor that we're expecting, and check it off.
-- In "already seen", we see a second naming of a constructor that we're no longer expecting, and fail.
-- In "never seen", we see a naming of a constructor before any naming of its decl, so we fail.
--
-- Next, we process all type decls. Each will again fall into one of three cases:
--
-- > +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
-- > | Case             | Mapping before       | Declaration | Num constructors | New mapping              |
-- > +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
-- > | Uninhabited decl |                      | #foo        | 0                |                          |
-- > | Inhabited decl   |                      | #foo        | 1 or more        | { #foo : {0, ..., n-1} } |
-- > | Already seen     | { foo : {0, 1, 2}  } | #foo        | Irrelevant       | Error: nested decl alias |
-- > +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
--
-- In "uninhabited decl", we find a decl with no constructors, so we don't expect anything new.
-- In "already seen", we find a second naming of a decl, whose constructors will necessarily violate coherency condition
--   (1) above.
--
-- In "inhabited decl", we find a decl with N constructors, and handle it by:
--   1. Adding to our state that we expect a name for each.
--   2. Recursing into the child namespace whose name matches the decl.
--   3. (If we return from the recursion without short-circuiting) remove the mapping added in step (1) and assert that
--      its value is the empty set (meaning we encountered a name for every constructor).
--
-- Note: This check could be moved into SQLite (with sufficient schema support) some day, but for now, we just do this
-- in memory.
--
-- Note: once upon a time, decls could be "incoherent". Then, we decided we want decls to be "coherent". Thus, this
-- machinery was invented.
