-- | Create a new project.
--
-- 1. If a project already exists with the given name, bail.
--
-- 2. Otherwise, create a scaffold out a new project with a "main" branch, and add it to the namespace (at a magic
--    location that the user isn't supposed to look at).
--
-- Big danger: we first commit the project identity and metadata (like its name) to the codebase, then manipulate our
-- in-memory namespace and flush its contents out in a separate transaction. This means that if lightning strikes at the
-- wrong time, we'll be in an inconsistent state.
--
-- This could be fixed in a few different ways:
--
--   1. Make a better `stepAt` helper that can mutate the namespace in a transaction.
--
--   2. Add more code to detect the inconsistency and work around it. For example, if we ever see that a project id
--      exists in the codebase but not at its corresponding place in the namespace, we could consider it garbage and
--      delete it. Then, any user who tried to create a project called "foo" shortly before getting hit by lightning
--      could simply try creating "foo" again later.
--
--   3. Don't store projects in the root namespace at all. We don't even want them there, it's just a little too
--      convenient because *not* storing them in the root namespace would require a lot of reworking and rewriting. We'd
--      rather hit some shorter-term project milestones and clean our mess up Later (TM).
--
-- For now, it doesn't seem worth it to do (1) or (2), since we want to do (3) eventually, and we'd rather not waste too
-- much time getting everything perfectly correct before we get there.
