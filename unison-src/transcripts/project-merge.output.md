  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      zonk : Nat

```ucm
  ☝️  The namespace .foo is empty.

.> merge.old foo foo/main

  Here's what's changed in foo/main after the merge:
  
  Added definitions:
  
    1. zonk : Nat
  
  Tip: You can use `todo` to see if this generated any work to
       do in this namespace and `test` to run the tests. Or you
       can use `undo` or `reflog` to undo the results of this
       merge.
