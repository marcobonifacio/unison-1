##### This transcript reproduces the failure to unlink documentation

Step 1: code a term and documentation for it
```unison
x = 1
x.doc = [: I am the documentation for x:]
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      x     : Nat
      x.doc : Doc

```
Step 2: add term and documentation, link, and check the documentation
```ucm
  ☝️  The namespace .trunk is empty.

.trunk> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    x     : Nat
    x.doc : Doc

.trunk> link x.doc x

```

```ucm
.trunk> add.trunk> link x.doc x.trunk> docs x
```


🛑

The transcript failed due to an error in the stanza above. The error is:
