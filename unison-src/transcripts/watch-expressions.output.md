  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      pass : [Result]
  
  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.

    1 | test> pass = [Ok "Passed"]
    
    ✅ Passed Passed

```

  ⚠️
  
  I had trouble decompiling some results.
  
  The following errors were encountered:
      A foreign value with no decompiled representation was
      encountered:
