  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      lib.new.foo : Int
      lib.old.foo : Nat
      thingy      : Nat

```
```ucm
proj/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    lib.new.foo : Int
    lib.old.foo : Nat
    thingy      : Nat

```
```ucm
proj/main> upgrade old new

  I couldn't automatically upgrade old to new. However, I've
  added the definitions that need attention to the top of
  scratch.u.

```
```unison:added-by-ucm scratch.u
thingy : Nat
thingy =
  use Nat +
  foo + 10
```
