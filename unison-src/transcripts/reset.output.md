       main branch.

foo/main> reset 2 main

  I'm not sure if you wanted to reset the branch foo/main or the
  namespace main in the current branch. Could you be more
  specific?
  
  1. /main (the branch main in the current project)
  2. main (the relative path main in the current branch)
  
  Tip: use `reset <some hash> 1` or `reset <some hash> 2` to
       pick one of these.

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    main.a : Nat

foo/topic> reset main

  I'm not sure if you wanted to reset to the branch foo/main or
  to the namespace main in the current branch. Could you be more
  specific?
  
  1. /main (the branch main in the current project)
  2. main (the relative path main in the current branch)
  
  Tip: use `reset 1` or `reset 2` to pick one of these.
