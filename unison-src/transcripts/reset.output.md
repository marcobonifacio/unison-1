       `switch /main` then `merge /topic`.

foo/main> reset 2 main

  I'm not sure if you wanted to reset the branch foo/main or the
  namespace main in the current branch. Could you be more
  specific?
  
  1. /main (the branch main in the current project)
  2. main (the relative path main in the current branch)
  
  Tip: use `reset <some hash> 1` or `reset <some hash> 2` to
       pick one of these.

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

  to the namespace main in the current branch. Could you be more
  specific?
  
  1. /main (the branch main in the current project)
  2. main (the relative path main in the current branch)
